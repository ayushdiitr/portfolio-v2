This project is a web-based chatbot application that can answer questions based on the content of a provided PDF document. The system is composed of two main parts: the frontend built with ReactJS and Material-UI (MUI), and the backend developed in Django with a machine learning (ML) model to process and retrieve answers from the PDF content.
