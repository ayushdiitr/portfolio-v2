Built from scratch an inventory management portal for managing the 250+ items within the lab with features like a
central login system, issue or return an item, notifying the lab when an item is low on stock etc.
Working with the team to take this application to the institute level, implementing role based access that would ease the
job of 500+ employees in IITR.
