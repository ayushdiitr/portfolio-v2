Developed a social networking Flutter app that connects travellers on the same flight or destination, enabling users to
network while waiting at the airport or during their trip.
Implemented a privacy feature that automatically deletes chats post-trip unless users intentionally want to connect
further.
Ensured users only see others who share the same flight or destination, enhancing relevance and real-time
communication among travellers.
